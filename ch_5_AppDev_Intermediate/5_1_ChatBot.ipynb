With BigDL-LLM, PyTorch models (in FP16/BF16/FP32) hosted on Hugging Face can be loaded and optimized automatically with low-bit quantizations (supported precisions include INT4/NF4/INT5/INT8).\n",

Section 5.1.3 will walk you through the process of building a chatbot using loaded model. You'll start from a simple form, and then add capabilities step by step, e.g. history management (for multi-turn chat) and streaming.  \n",
