    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) is a popular library for developing applications powered by language models. You can use LangChain with LLMs to build various interesting applications such as [Chatbot](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/python/llm/example/langchain/transformers_int4/chat.py), [Document Q&A](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/python/llm/example/langchain/transformers_int4/docqa.py), [voice assistant](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/python/llm/example/langchain/transformers_int4/voiceassistant.py). BigDL-LLM provides LangChain integrations (i.e. LLM wrappers and embeddings) and you can use them the same way as [other LLM wrappers in LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/). \n",
