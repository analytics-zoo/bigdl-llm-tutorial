For such models, ipex-llm also provides a set of APIs to support them. We will now demonstrate how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use `ipex_llm.transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM` to load the `open_llama_3b_v2 model`. This API mirrors the official `transformers.AutoModelForCasualLM` with only a few additional parameters and methods related to low-bit optimization in the loading process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable INT4 optimization, simply set `load_in_4bit=True` in `from_pretrained`. Additionally, we configure the parameters `torch_dtype=\"auto\"` and `low_cpu_mem_usage=True` by default, as they may improve both performance and memory efficiency. "

    "You can use `save_low_bit` once and use `load_low_bit` many times for inference. This approach bypasses the processes of loading the original FP32/FP16 model and optimization during inference stage, saving both memory and time. Moreover, because the optimized model format is platform-agnostic, you can seamlessly perform saving and loading operations across various machines, regardless of their operating systems. This flexibility enables you to perform optimization/saving on a high-RAM server and deploy the model for inference on a PC with limited RAM.\n",
